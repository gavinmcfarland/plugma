# Migrating from V1 to V2

Plugma v2 brings major improvements, including separated Vite configurations for main and UI contexts, first-class testing support with Vitest and Playwright, easy integration of tools via the `add` command, widget support, and production-like behaviour in development.

## Breaking changes

- `process.env` is no longer supported by default. See [Referencing Env Variables](#referencing-env-variables)
- `-ws, --websockets` is no longer supported. See [Command Line Changes](#command-line-changes)
- iframe origin is now `null` during development [Iframe Origin](#iframe-origin)
- window events behaviour now matches production [Window Events Behaviour](#window-events-behaivour)

## Required Changes

These changes are necessary for your plugin to work with Plugma v2 and future versions.

### Update your `manifest` file

This is either your `manifest.json` file or the `manifest` field in your `package.json`.

Remove Plugma specific `devAllowedDomains`. These are now added automatically.

```diff
"networkAccess": {
    // ...
-   "devAllowedDomains": [
-       "http://localhost:*",
-       "ws://localhost:9001",
-   ]
}
```

### Update your `vite.config` file

You should now define what config Vite uses for the `main` and the `ui` context. You can do this using the `context` parameter.

```diff
export default defineConfig(({ context }) => {
	return {
-       plugins: [react()],
+		plugins: context === 'ui' ? [react()] : [],
	}
})
```

<!--
Alternatively you can create seperate files for the `main` and `ui` context, named respectively:

- `vite.config.main.ts`
- `vite.config.ui.ts`
-->

### Adding Support for `env` Types (recommended)

If you're using TypeScript, you can add a reference for the new context parameter type definition at the top of the file by adding the following `vite-env.d.ts` to the `src` directory of your plugin.

```ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

import 'vite';
import type { UserConfigExport } from 'vite';

declare module 'vite' {
    interface ConfigEnv {
        context?: 'ui' | 'main';
    }

    // Overload defineConfig to acknowledge the context parameter
    function defineConfig(config: (env: ConfigEnv) => UserConfigExport): UserConfigExport;
}
```

Then reference it at the top of your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
/// <reference path="./src/vite-env.d.ts" />
```

### Referencing Env variables

This applies only if you were referencing environment variables in your main code using `process.env`.

All environment variables used by Plugma must be prefixed with `VITE_` and referenced using the `import.meta.env` object. The `VITE_` prefix is required to mark these variables as exposed to the client explicitly. This applies to both main-thread and UI code, because even though main-thread code doesn't render in the UI, it still runs in the client context where the bundled code is exposed and can be inspected.

#### Example changes required

```diff
// .env
- SOME_KEY=123
+ VITE_SOME_KEY=123
```

```diff
// main.js
- console.log(process.env.SOME_KEY)
+ console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY)
```

### Iframe Origin

The iframe origin of the plugin has been updated to `null` to match what is used in production. If you relied on this during development the workaround is to use a local development server that supports cross origin for development purposes.

### Window Events Behaivour

In Plugma V1, some events, like drop eventsâ€”didn't work the same in development as they did in production. This was because the UI was hosted on an external server. Now, Plugma still uses a server, but the UI is embedded directly using a data URI, which better matches how plugins run in production.

### Command Line Changes

These changes only affect users who were using specific features in v1. If you weren't using these features, you can skip this section.

- WebSocket support is now enabled by default. If you were using the `-ws, --websockets` flag, you can remove it as it's no longer needed. If you need to disable WebSocket support, you can use the new `--no-websockets` flag.
    
## Other Notable Updates

## New CLI Wizard

The `create-plugma` cli has been completely revamped to support the following:

- You can now create widgets
- Brand new CLI that's more intuitive and guides you through the process
- A new and recommended file organisation for plugins and widgets
- Ability to add integrations
- Option to install dependencies with your preferred package manager

```bash
npm create plugma@latest
```

### Add Integrations

You can now integrate new third-party libraries and tools using the following:

```bash
npm create plugma@latest add
```

These include:

- Prettier
- Tailwind
- ESLint
- Shadcn
- Vitest (experimental)
- Playwright (experimental)

Each integration will automatically scaffold the necessary files and configuration, sparing you the manual setup.

### Type-safe manifest file

You can now manage your manifest in a TypeScript file.

```ts
import { defineManifest } from 'plugma';

export default defineManifest({
    id: 'com.my-plugin',
    name: 'My Plugin',
    api: '1.0.0',
    main: 'src/main.ts',
    ui: 'src/ui.ts',
    editorType: ['figma', 'figjam'],
    networkAccess: {
        allowedDomains: ['none'],
    }
);
```

### Custom `index.html` Entry Point

By default, Plugma uses its own index template for the UI process. However, you can use your own template by adding an `index.html` file to the root of your project.

Just make sure to include the <!--[ PLUGIN_UI ]--> placeholder where the Plugma generated UI code will be injected.

**Example**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title><!--[ PLUGIN_NAME ]--></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <!--[ PLUGIN_UI ]-->
    </body>
</html>
```
