# Developer tools

Plugma comes with several developer tools to make developing plugins easier, with more coming soon.

## Developer toolbar

The developer tool bar allows you to open the browser preview, minimise the plugin window and clear `clientStorage` and `pluginData`. You can open the developer toolbar by clicking into the plugin window and pressing <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.

##### Websockets URL button

With websockets enabled you can click on the websockets connection icon to open the browser preview.

##### Minimise plugin window

When you don't want the plugin window to get in the way of your canvas you can minimise the plugin window by clicking the "Minimise window" option from the more menu.

##### Clear clientStorage

Plugma makes it convenient to delete `clientStorage` while deverloping by clicking the "Delete client storage" option from the more menu.
