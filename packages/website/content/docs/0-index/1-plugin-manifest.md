# Plugin manifest

The manifest defines your Figma pluginâ€™s core settings, including plugin details and network configurations. Here's how to set up the manifest to work with Plugma.

You can see the full list of available fields in Figma's [plugin manifest documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/).

## Manifest location

Configure the plugin manifest by adding a `plugma.manifest` field to the `package.json` file or placing a `manifest.json` file in the project root.

##### Example using package.json

```jsonc
{
	//...
	"plugma": {
		"manifest": {
			"name": "My Plugin",
			"id": "com.example.myplugin",
			"api": "1.0.0",
			"main": "src/code.js",
			"ui": "src/ui.js"
		}
	}
}
```

## Plugin files

The `main` and `ui` fields must point to the source files and not the dist files. The `ui` field should point to where the UI is mounted.

```jsonc
{
	//...
	"main": "src/main.js",
	"ui": "src/ui.js"
}
```

The UI source file is bundled into a html file, which can be referenced in the `main` code using `figma.showUI` with the `__html__` constant.

<blockquote class="warning">
Plugma currently does not allow using a map for the `ui` field, which means `__uiFiles__` is not yet supported.
</blockquote>

## DevAllowedDomains

### Localhost

While developing locally, Plugma uses a local dev server. This server must be specified in the `devAllowedDomains` field to ensure that Figma only accepts this domain, blocking others unless they are specified in `allowedDomains`.

```jsonc
{
	// ...
	"networkAccess": {
		"allowedDomains": ["http://example"],
		"devAllowedDomains": ["http://localhost:*"]
	}
}
```

<blockquote class="info">
Using a wildcard `*` for the port number, such as `http://localhost:*`, will ensure your setup works with any local port that Plugma assigns to the dev server.
</blockquote>

### Websockets

If you're using WebSockets for previewing in the browser or unit testing, it's important the URL for the WebSocket server (e.g., `ws://localhost:*`) is listed under `devAllowedDomains`. This allows Plugma to connect over WebSockets when developing and testing locally.

```jsonc
{
	// ...
	"networkAccess": {
		// ...
		"devAllowedDomains": [
            "http://localhost:*",
            "ws://localhost:*"
        ]
	}
}
```
