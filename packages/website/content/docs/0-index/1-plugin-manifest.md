# Plugin manifest

The manifest defines your Figma pluginâ€™s core settings, including plugin details and network configurations. Here's how to set up the manifest to work with Plugma.

You can see the full list of available fields in Figma's [plugin manifest documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/).

## Manifest location

The manifest can be configured by placing a `manifest.json` file in the project root or by adding a `plugma.manifest` field to the `package.json` file.

##### Example using package.json

```jsonc
{
	//...
	"plugma": {
		"manifest": {
			"name": "My Plugin",
			"id": "com.example.myplugin",
			"api": "1.0.0",
			"main": "src/code.js",
			"ui": "src/ui.js"
		}
	}
}
```

## Main and UI fields

When setting up your plugin, ensure the `main` and `ui` fields in your manifest point to your source code files (e.g., src/main.js and src/ui.js), not the built files in `dist`. The `ui` field should point to the file where the plugin's interface is mounted.

```jsonc
{
	//...
	"main": "src/main.js",
	"ui": "src/ui.js"
}
```

The UI can be referenced in the `main` code using `figma.showUI` with the `__html__` constant.

<blockquote class="warning">
Plugma currently does not allow using a map for the `ui` field, which means `__uiFiles__` is not yet supported.
