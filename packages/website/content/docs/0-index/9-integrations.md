# Integrations

Plugma makes it easy to add integrations with other libraries and frameworks. With a single command, Plugma will set up the entire integration for you - adding configuration files, providing example code and installing dependencies, to get you started.

## Usage

```package-manager
npm create plugma add
```

Running the command without specifying an integration will show you a list of available options to choose from.
