- Your notes folder is `.claude-notes` (at the root of the workspace or projects in monorepos) is yours to use. Only you will ever read the contents in there. Use it to store plans, task lists, notes, learnings, and important reminders for you.
- When your response contains the code of a markdown file, code blocks inside said markdown file MUST use "~~~"
- when importing node native modules, like fs or url, always prepend them with 'node:', like in 'node:fs' and 'node:url'
- Always document exported functions, classes, types, etc with a robust TSDoc comment. Also document complex functions, even if not exported.
- Use "for ... of" loops instead `.forEach`.
- to prevent issues with commands being aliased, always use `command BUILTIN` for built-in commands, like `command cat` or `command ls`.
- When fixing test failures:
  1. Analyze test structure and organization:
     - Verify all imports are hoisted to the top
     - Check that vi.hoisted() is used for mock objects
     - Ensure mock implementations are defined before use
  2. Review mock setup and implementation:
     - Verify centralized mocks object contains all required mocks
     - Check mock functions return appropriate values/promises
     - Ensure consistent mocking patterns are used
  3. Validate module mocking:
     - Confirm all external modules are mocked with vi.mock()
     - Verify mocked implementations reference hoisted mocks
     - Check mock implementations match expected behavior
  4. Inspect test lifecycle management:
     - Review beforeEach/afterEach setup and cleanup
     - Verify mocks are cleared between test runs
     - Check initialization state is correct
  5. Debug test execution:
     - Run tests and capture detailed error output
     - Analyze failure messages and stack traces
     - Fix issues iteratively, verifying each change
  6. Common failure points to check:
     - File operations match mock filesystem state
     - Async operations resolve in expected order
     - Event handlers and watchers trigger correctly
     - Collections/sets have proper initial state
